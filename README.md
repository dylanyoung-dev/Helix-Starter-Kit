# Helix Starter Kit

This is a Helix Starter Kit.  What makes it different than Habitat, Habitat Home or Helixbase? Well it's simple, those aren't truly built to be starter kits for your development project.  We provide bear essentials and allow you the development manager to decide where you want to take this tool.  It's great for smaller projects that can include component development for the Sitecore marketplace, or as big of projects as multiple sites running in a Sitecore instance.

We've made some assumptions, that you can use for your project that you are starting.  But don't worry, if you are looking for a Helix starter kit that uses a didn't ORM Wrapper/Mapper or a different tool for serializing items, we are working on different projects coming soon that are based on different technology stacks.

    - Sitecore Helix
	- .Net MVC
	- Sitecore 9.0.1
	- Unicorn
	- Glass Mapper 5
	- Yeoman for module creation
	- Leprechaun for template class generation

In addition, it includes scaffolding and developer enhancements, to make development quicker.  To learn more about these enhancements, please read more about these commands that you can run in the `Getting Started` section.

## Installation

## Getting Started

Once you've got your local development environment running, the next step should include building your first modules using the starter kit.  It's actually extremely to do this, using a node tool known as Yeoman.  It's a scaffolding tool, that allows you to specify different options to scaffold out a new module (no matter which layer it'll reside in).
