# This file contains setting that you've initially configured or values that you have set while using your Yeoman generator.  Once you've specified an option that should be re-usable, it will get stored in this document.  If you ever want to change the value, either set it in this document to the value you are looking for, or remove the setting and Yeoman should ask you for your input again.
